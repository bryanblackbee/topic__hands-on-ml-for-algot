# 14. Topic Modelling

## Introduction

The document-term matrix model is useful to query documents based on token content, but are very high-dimensional and sparse. Hence, it does little to summarise the content or to get closer to understanding what this content is talking about.

Hence, we turn to topic modelling to extract themes from documents. Themes are useful to find clusters of similar documents and can be helpful for annotations. These techniques can be used to traverse earnings reports, earnings call transcripts, company disclosures and more.

## Latent Topics
Topic models are used to summarise large collections of documents to facilitate organisation, management and search and recommendations. They aim to address the curse of dimensionality that plague the BoW model. Furthermore, it addresses the polysematic problem that the BoW model cannot capture.

The key models for discussion are:
1. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
2. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA)
3. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
